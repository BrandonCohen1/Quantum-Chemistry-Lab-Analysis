In a year-long lab, I performed quantum chemistry and spectroscopic experiments. For each experiment, I performed data analysis and data cleaning using Python. 
Experiments included:
  1. Computational Chemistry using Gaussian 16
  2. Kinetics of a Diffusion-Controlled Reaction
  3. FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) of Protein Folding
  4. Rotavibrational Analysis of the Infrared Spectrum of HCl/DCl
  5. Analysis of Viscosity, Molecular Weight, and Head-to-Head Ratio of PVOH
  6. Kinetics and Thermodynamical Analysis of the Aquation of Dichloridobis(ethane-1,2-diamine)Cobalt (III)
